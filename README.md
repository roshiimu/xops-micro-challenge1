# XOps Micro-Challenge 1

This project was built as part of the Celcom XOps Prime Community's first micro-challenge.

The task was to create a basic web app using HTML and CSS, and then containerize it using Docker. The idea was to get hands-on with building something simple, wrapping it in a container, and seeing it run locally.

The page includes a welcome message, some basic styling, and a bit of interactivity. It was a great way to practice:

- How HTML and CSS work together
- How to use Docker to package an app
- How to serve a static site from a container

This was my first step into containerizing simple web apps, and it helped me understand the flow from writing code to running it inside a container. Nothing fancy â€” just learning by doing.
